The x (execute) permission on a directory, such as the journal directory, allows users to traverse (navigate into) the directory and access its contents. Here are some reasons why the x permission might be necessary for the journal directory: 
Traversal Access: The x permission is required to enter the directory and access its files and subdirectories. Without this permission, users cannot navigate into the directory, even if they have read (r) or write (w) permissions on the directory itself. 
File Access: If users need to read or execute files within the journal directory, they must have x permission on the directory to access those files. For example, to read a file within the journal directory, a user needs both r permission on the file and x permission on the journal directory. 
Subdirectory Access: If the journal directory contains subdirectories, users need x permission on the journal directory to navigate into these subdirectories. Without the x permission, they cannot enter the subdirectories, even if they have the necessary permissions on the files within those subdirectories. 
System Functionality: In the context of system directories like journal, the x permission is often necessary for system processes and services to access and operate on the files and subdirectories within it. This ensures that system functionalities that depend on the journal directory can function properly. 
Security Considerations: While the x permission allows traversal, it does not necessarily grant the ability to list the contents of the directory (which is controlled by the r permission). This means that users can enter the directory but cannot see its contents unless they also have r permission. 
In summary, the x permission on the journal directory is essential for users and system processes to traverse the directory and access its contents and subdirectories.
